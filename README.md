# Usage

Engage with your .png files effortlessly through this application:

- **Command Line:** Utilize the command line for direct access.

- **Drag and Drop:** Simply drop the file onto SD EXIF Editor.exe or a link to it.

- **Recommended Method:** Integrate with `FastStone ImageViewer` by adding `SD EXIF Editor.exe` as an External Program. Then, use the `E` shortcut for quick access.

# Troubleshooting

I strive for perfection, but I acknowledge that some rare cases or unusual metadata properties from the webui might be overlooked. If you encounter issues such as missing properties or errors, please:

1. Create an issue detailing the error codes.

I'm committed to resolving any issues promptly.
